🏨 Hotel Reservation System (Java)
Hotel Reservation System is a simple Java console-based application that manages room bookings and basic hotel operations. It allows users to view rooms, search available rooms by category, book and cancel reservations, and view booking details. The system also saves booking data to a file so records are preserved between program runs.

✨ Features
* View all hotel rooms with status (Available / Booked)
* Search available rooms by category (Standard, Deluxe, Suite)
* Book a room with simulated payment
* Cancel an existing booking
* View all booking details
* Save and load bookings using file handling

 🛠️ Technologies Used
Java
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* ArrayList Collection
* File Handling (File, FileWriter, Scanner)
* Console-based menu interface

 📂 Project Structure
* `main.Main` – Main program and menu handling
* `model.Room` – Room data model
* `model.Booking` – Booking data model

▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code)
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file
4. Follow the on-screen menu to manage bookings
🎯 Purpose
This project is designed for beginners to practice Java fundamentals such as classes, objects, collections, loops, file handling, and modular design. It is suitable for academic projects, internships, and learning purposes.

 📌 Future Enhancements
* User login system
* Real payment integration
* Database support instead of text file
* Date-wise booking and availability check
* Admin panel and reporting features
